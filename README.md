# Payday/*Welcome To Payday*/
Project Copyright Galen Hite 2015
Version 1.0.0

This project simulates the classic Parker Brothers game Payday. You can find the rules for the game here: http://www.boardgamecapital.com/payday-rules.htm

It is a basic engine for completeing the game
in little or no time, as opposed to trying to play through it, which takes a very long time, requires no stratagy
on the part of the player.

This project requires no installation. You have already downloaded the project. Run the .jar file to begin playing.

When you've launched it, you'll see a menu. You can enter the number of players, and the number of months
(currently defaulting to 4) and then press Go to run. A window will flash up giving the amount of money the
players possessed at the end of each month. Currently, the rest of the information is being spit out into 
command line, and will be shown in the window in later versions. You can move the Stat Window to the side 
to see the original screen again, and press go to rerun.
